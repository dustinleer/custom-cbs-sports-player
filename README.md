# Custom CBD Sports Player Experience
Customizes the CBS Sports Player

This is just some fun I had in the custom stylesheets editor. Just open your browser inspector on the CBS Sports player and add an inspector-stylesheet on a non-iframe element and add the CSS to get a better, in my opion of their player.

You can use [User JavaScript and CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) from the Chrome store to inject the CSS on the page too!
